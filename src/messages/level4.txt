I hope you memorized all of that. You will need it later. For now let's take a tour of the office.
You better remember all of this. Not reminding you.
I'm so pissed right now because this dumba** intern Chesmond got angry and destroyed the router. He had to go.
I think we'll assign you to recovering the lost data from the company database.
We share our locker space with a local gym, so it's been broken in.
By the way, we don't hire employees with a history of anger issues.
We don't allow bowl cuts in the workplace because they remind me of Chesmond.
Due to regulations we had to shorten the wifi password, now it's vulnerable.
Wait... I think we have locker keys.
What do you mean you wanna change your data access pin? You won't be using it.
<i>Your</i> pin's insecure? Nobody's gonna guess it. The chances are 1-81. Stop complaining.
We do not tolerate complainers or excuses. Get the work done or you're out.
