## Getting Started

This application is a typing game with a twist. There are no mistakes allowed! Players will have take on a challenge promising to exceedingly increase accuracy and performance as each mistake will send you to the start of the level.

The game is broken up into 3 categories: Campaign, Training, and Reading. 
  Campaign is a story that is supposed to easy the player into the difficulty, and will see much revision over time. 
  Training is by far the hardest mode, with a random word, symbol, number, and capitalization generator. If you want to improve at all keys on the keyboard (programmers
    I'm looking at you) this is a great mode for you.
  Reading mode is my favorite, since it has you reading while improving your typing speed. This is an intellectual's wet dream! Multitasking techniques and KNOWLEDGE!
    You can pick from over 40,000 books thanks to the Project Gutenburg Database.

I left the code open-source for use in my portfolio, so I'll most likely be updating the code to contain more comments and overall use better programming fundamentals.
  I threw this together for my final project in my first quarter at UWB since Professor Linn allowed us to make any project of our choosing, as long as it fit the 
  criteria. I ended up continuing development of this project because I felt the application is very useful to me. I intend to make many more projects that are useful
  as development or practice tools.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
