On the first floor we have our reception desk, and through this door is the office workspace. Each room is about 200 square feet. The bathroom's up the stairs, to the left, down the ladder, and on the right. Just make sure to turn the fan on during use and switch it off ten minutes after. Up ahead is the cafeteria, all our food is fresh and organic.
