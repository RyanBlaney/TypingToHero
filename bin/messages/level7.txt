Congrats! You've proved that you coded a day in your life. Now for a challenge.
You can do it.
How did you get a degree in the first place.
Are you sure you're a Java Developer?
I don't know if this is the right career path for you.
You should try web development.
How did you even graduate.
I'm thinking you forged your diploma.
Skill issue?
Please don't embarrass me in front of the company.
I have a bad feeling about this.
This is gonna be a rough few months.
