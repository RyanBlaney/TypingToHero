Good. You know now to keep your eyes peeled. Just one more to test your work ethic.
Pay attention.
Look... with your eyes.
There's no way you fell  for that.
Oldest trick in the book.
If you think about it... you're overthinking it.
You aren't even being timed yet.
I got an idea...
You're still on the easy part. Don't worry.
Awww it's ok mistakes happen. Cheer up and keep trying.
I'm thinking of crossing your name off the list. Prove me wrong.
If you're having a bad day, f*ck it. Try again tomorrow.
If you finish soon we can begin your training.
...
You can do better than that.
If you fail to see a coworker's mistake before the changes are pushed, you are also at fault.
Focus... Focus.
